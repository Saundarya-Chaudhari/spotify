 The aim is to develop a machine learning model using the Spotify dataset to predict the popularity of songs. The model will utilize a range of features, both current and historical, to make accurate predictions.

#Objective
The objective of the "Spotify Popularity Prediction - Machine Learning" project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the popularity of songs on the Spotify music streaming platform. By analyzing various song features and historical data, the model aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to a song's popularity, allowing artists, music labels, and users to make informed decisions about song selection, promotion strategies, and playlist curation.

#Synopsis:
The popularity of a song plays a crucial role in its success, and understanding the factors that contribute to its popularity can greatly benefit artists, music labels, and streaming platforms.

The project begins by gathering a large dataset of songs from Spotify, including their important features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, loudness etc.

Next, the dataset is preprocessed by cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning. This may involve handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

With the preprocessed dataset, various machine learning algorithms can be explored and evaluated. This includes techniques such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or even more advanced methods like gradient boosting.

Once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to predict the popularity of new songs.
